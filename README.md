## Usage

- Choose between Facelet View/Open Cube View. 
- Enter a scrambled cube state by using the color picker.
- Make sure to orient your cube like shown in the image while entering the colors. This is important, if the orientation is wrong, CubeX will show an `invalid cube sate` error. If the Cubelet View is confusing , try the Open Cube View, which gives a better sense of the expected orintation.
- Press on solve.
- Follow the animated instructions to solve your cube.
